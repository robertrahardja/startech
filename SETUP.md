# Startech Innovation - Contact Form Setup

This guide explains how to set up the contact form email functionality using Resend and Cloudflare Pages Functions.

## Overview

The contact form uses:
- **Resend** - Modern email API for sending transactional emails
- **Cloudflare Pages Functions** - Serverless functions that handle form submissions

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create a Resend Account

1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for a free account (includes 3,000 emails/month)
3. Verify your email address

### 2. Get Your Resend API Key

1. Log in to your Resend dashboard
2. Navigate to **API Keys** section
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Give it a name (e.g., "Startech Website Contact Form")
5. Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Save this key securely - you won't be able to see it again!

### 3. Verify Your Domain (Recommended)

To send emails from `noreply@startech-innovation.com`:

1. In Resend dashboard, go to **Domains**
2. Click **Add Domain**
3. Enter: `startech-innovation.com`
4. Follow the instructions to add DNS records:
   - Add the provided TXT, MX, and CNAME records to your domain's DNS settings
5. Wait for verification (usually takes a few minutes to a few hours)

**Alternative**: Until domain is verified, use Resend's test domain `onboarding@resend.dev` (edit `functions/api/contact.js` line 59)

### 4. Configure Cloudflare Pages

#### For Production Deployment:

1. Log in to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
2. Go to **Workers & Pages**
3. Select your Startech website project
4. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
5. Click **Add Variable**
6. Add:
   - **Variable name**: `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your Resend API key (paste the key you copied)
   - **Environment**: Production
7. Click **Save**
8. Redeploy your site for changes to take effect

#### For Local Development:

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
   ```

2. Edit `.dev.vars` and add your actual Resend API key:
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

3. Install Wrangler CLI (Cloudflare's development tool):
   ```bash
   npm install -g wrangler
   ```

4. Run local development server:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler pages dev .
   ```

5. Open http://localhost:8788 to test locally

### 5. Customize Email Settings (Optional)

Edit `/functions/api/contact.js` to customize:

**Change recipient email** (line 60):
```javascript
to: ['your-email@example.com'], // Change this
```

**Add multiple recipients**:
```javascript
to: ['info@startech-innovation.com', 'sales@startech-innovation.com'],
```

**Change sender email** (line 59):
```javascript
from: 'Startech Website <noreply@startech-innovation.com>', // Must be verified domain
```

**Customize email subject** (line 61):
```javascript
subject: `New Inquiry from ${name}`, // Customize this
```

## Testing

### Test the Form:

1. Go to your website
2. Fill out the contact form
3. Click Submit
4. You should see: "Thank you for your message! We will get back to you soon."
5. Check your inbox at `info@startech-innovation.com`

### Troubleshooting:

**Form shows error message:**
- Check browser console (F12) for error details
- Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is set correctly in Cloudflare dashboard
- Ensure you've redeployed after adding environment variables

**Emails not arriving:**
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify domain in Resend dashboard (if using custom domain)
- Check Resend dashboard ‚Üí **Logs** to see if emails were sent
- Verify recipient email address in `functions/api/contact.js`

**"Email service is not configured" error:**
- Environment variable `RESEND_API_KEY` is missing
- Redeploy your site after adding the variable

**Domain verification pending:**
- Temporarily use `onboarding@resend.dev` as sender
- Check DNS records are correctly added
- Wait up to 24-48 hours for DNS propagation

## Pricing

### Resend:
- **Free tier**: 3,000 emails/month (more than enough for contact forms)
- **Pro plan**: $20/month for 50,000 emails

### Cloudflare Pages Functions:
- **Free tier**: 100,000 requests/day (contact form submissions)
- **Paid plan**: $5/month for 10 million requests

**Total Cost for Typical Use**: $0/month (both free tiers are generous)
